       <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>Witches' brew is a fun Halloween attention-getter that's perfect for parties. A fake hand is frozen in a disposable glove and then slipped into the punch bowl!
       </p>
       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
           <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen raspberries, thawed</li>
           <li>2 Â½ cups cranberry juice</li>
           <li>2 envelopes unflavored gelatin</li>
           <li>2 liters ginger ale</li>
           <li>2 liters sparkling apple cider (non-alcoholic)</li>
           <li>6 gummi snakes candy</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
           <li>To make the frozen hand: Wash and rinse the outside of a rubber glove. Turn glove inside out and set aside. In a 4-cup measuring cup, combine the thawed raspberries and cranberry juice.</li>
           <li>Pour 2 cups of the raspberry mixture into a small saucepan. Sprinkle the gelatin over and let stand 2 minutes. Warm over low heat, stirring constantly, just until gelatin dissolves. Mix back into the reserved raspberry mixture in the measuring cup.</li>
           <li>Pour raspberry mixture into the inverted glove. Gather up the top of the glove and tie securely with kitchen twine. Freeze until solid, or several days if possible.</li>
           <li>To serve: Carefully cut glove to remove from frozen hand. Place frozen hand, palm side up, leaning against side of a large punch bowl. Pour in ginger ale and sparkling cider. Garnish with gummy snakes.</li>
